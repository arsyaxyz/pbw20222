          <h2>Candy Crush Saga</h2>
          <p>Candy Crush Saga is a free-to-play tile-matching video game released by King on April 12, 2012, originally for Facebook; other versions for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and Windows 10 followed. It is a variation of their browser game Candy Crush. In the game, players complete levels by swapping colored pieces of candy on a game board to make a match of three or more of the same color, eliminating those candies from the board and replacing them with new ones, which could potentially create further matches. Matches of four or more candies create unique candies that act as power-ups with larger board-clearing abilities. Boards have various goals that must be completed within a fixed number of moves or a limited amount of time, such as a certain score or collecting a specific number of a type of candy.</p>

          <h2>PUBG: Battlegrounds</h2>
          <p>PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Studios, a subsidiary of Krafton. The game, which was inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever tightening space to force encounters. The last surviving player (or team) wins the round. It is the first game in the PUBG Universe series.</p>
